## Remembering Carnivale and HBO's Phase Two

Imagine what the vibe was like at HBO in 2003. To say things were working out would be an understatement. Here's what they had been up to:

- Oz (1997)
- The Soprannos (1999)
- Six Feet Under (2001)
- The Wire (2002).

NOT TOO FUCKING BAD!

Their strategy -- Draft bold, ambitious writers and give them the open ground to build the world
as they imagine -- was paying off. Those series from '97-'02 can be thought of as Phase One of the HBO campaign.
Phase Two, beginning with Carnivale(2003), Deadwood(2004), and Rome(2005) has a less decorated legacy.

In Phase Two, HBO was trying to redraw the boundaries between film and TV. All three of theese series look like movies.

**Deadwood** changed the way every Western has been imagined since.

**Rome** prooved that TV could scale to the size needed for a period drama.
One could argue that there would never have been a Game of Thrones without Rome.

And **Carnivale**, a show that rarely gets any love these days, comnbined myth, the occult, and a traveling circus into
_The Grapes of Wrath_ on LSD.

These three series all had untimely and controversial ends.
