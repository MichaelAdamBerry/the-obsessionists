## Garcia's People

## Live at Trans Pecos - 3-24-19

This weeks featured show of the week was found via a recommendation by Jeff Conklin. If you are interested
in what's happening in the psychedelic rock/folk space, you should really be following Jeff as he has
his ear to the ground on what's happening.

This show is simultaneously welcoming, spacey, and trippy. Happy Summer, kiddos.
