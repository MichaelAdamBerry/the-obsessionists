Time Travelling is a “big tent” type of storytelling trope. It has been employed in such genres as Cerebral SciFy, Cyber Punk, Stoner Comedies, Neo Noir, Low-budget Independent, and Blockbuster Action & Adventure as well as many more..

Equally diverse are varying degrees of scientific and theoretical seriousness given to the concept of humans being able to break free of the limits of time. In the best line in Looper, Bruce Willis’ character says to Joseph Gordon Levitt’s character (who is a younger version of Bruce WIllis’ character),

“I don't want to talk about time travel because if we start talking about it, then we're going to be here all day talking about it, making diagrams with straws.”

He’s not wrong. Still there are a lot of really mind-bending ideas to consider once you start to deal with the implications of time travel- and as a bonus they all have completely winning names. The Bootstrap Paradox, The Grandfather Paradox. The post ----gives a primer on these conundrums and which films explore which concepts.

Some other interesting differences time travel goes down:

- Characters jumping back to the past or forward to the future. Although an overwhelming majority go back in time rather than forward.
- Some characters plan meticulously in how they will make the jump, and some are just trying to escape Libyan terrorists outside a strip mall.
- Some are cryogenically frozen (Austen Power, Demolition Man, Forever Young) and are woken up, purposefully or not, years later. Technically time travel.
- Some, in outer space, enter a wormhole or end moving at speeds so fast that their experience of time is so altered that they have jumped forward in time, which we know is possibly, thanks to our pal, Al Einstein,
- Some machines are hacked together in a garage, some fashioned from a 1980s luxury car, and some are just a jacuzzi that someone spilled and energy drink into.

What all of these stories have in common is this : they ask us to question and examine our own relationship with the past, present and future (even the one with the jacuzzi). The characters, like us, are living with regrets, and desire to atone for the past and glimpse the unknown of the future.

This is the The Obsession-ists, a site dedicated to asking why we tell the stories that we tell. Every month there will be a new genre, plot device, or archetype to delve into. This issue is all about time travel. It is a common trope in time travel narratives for the lines between beginning and end to become blurred and for cause and effect to loop into each other. With that in mind and depending on where you may be, we hope you enjoy the beginning, middle, or end of this series. Happy travels.
