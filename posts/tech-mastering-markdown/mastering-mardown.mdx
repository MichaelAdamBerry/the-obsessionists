# Why use Markdown anyway?

I encountered Markdown when I first started programming and pushing code to Github.
I didn't understand why I needed to learn these strange formatting rules just to write some text.
Couldn't I just Word or Google Docs in order to render text? Well fast forward a few years and now I
write markdown for just about any text I need to write. It's a great way to simplify and streamline
your work flow.

## The benefits of markdown are threefold.

### Ease of Formatting

First you have to a simplified set of rules to quickly and uniformly format text,
render images and create links. You can look at the bottom of this post for a simple
cheatsheet for the basic commands that will help you get up and running.

### Plaintext

A file written in markdown is just a plain-text file. You don't need to have additional software like
Word. Have you ever tried to open a Word with Notepad? What you see in unreadable plaintext. Markdown
allows us to write in a format that can be read on different machines and is mostly software
agnostic.

### It's Made to Play Nice With the Internet

The best part about Markdown and why every developer should know it, is that it renders to html.
That's why many journalists and blogers use it, so they can spend their time writing instead of
formatting html tags. GraphQL makes it possible to query markdown and css and javascript templates
can make it so that anyone can post dynamic content to the web without being an expert in web
development.
